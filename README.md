3. Dataset

The datasets worked on were created by 7 university students and uploaded to kaggle. Due to the dimension of the raw data, a link will be provided instead of including it in the repository. The user will need to download and re-run the jupyter notebook to play with the data. 

The link to the spotify kaggle database: https://www.kaggle.com/pepepython/spotify-huge-database-daily-charts-over-3-years?select=Final+database.csv
